Data classification problem on the example of handwritten digits (MNIST dataset).
Software implementation of multilayer perceptron architecture and back propagation method.
The user writes the digit by hand. The program analyzes the input data and subjects it to classification.

Additional information.
The training sample size is 60'000. The control dataset consists of 10'000 digits. The final result is ~89%.
The training took about 2 hours (3500 epochs). 
Activation function: sigmoid. 
Learning rate changed statically as the neural network was being trained.
